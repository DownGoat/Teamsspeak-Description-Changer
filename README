This short script is used to change the description of the random channel on my
Teamspeak server. It randomly selects a image in a directory and sets the
description of the channel to that image. The script should be easy to modify
to change the behavior.

This script uses https://github.com/nikdoof/python-ts3 to talk to TS.
